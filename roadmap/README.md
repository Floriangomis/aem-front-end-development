AEM and Front End Roadmap
===============================

##CSS PreProcessors

###What are CSS Preprocessors?

CSS by itself is a static declarative styling language that requires the developer to write out every line of code and or copy and paste and make adjustments.

With the introduction of preprocessing CSS the developer has the ability to use variables as well as mixins that can output complex CSS with a couple of arguments passed to the mixin.

SASS, LESS and COMPASS are currently the leading CSS preprocessors.

##Task Managers

As front-end development continues to evolve at an ever-increasing pace, developers are creating tools and automated processing that improves our workflows.

###GruntJS
Is a JavaScript Task runner with plugins to aid in JavaScript template pre-compiling, minification, linting, file concatenation and so much more.  Grunt does have a dependency on NODEJS

###GulpJS
Similar to Grunt except that it does not write intermediary files to .tmp folder during processing. It also boasts higher speeds than that of Grunt, however I believe the speed difference will be similar with the release of the 0.5 version of Grunt.
