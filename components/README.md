##Components

###Components are reusable modules that display content and are draggable onto a parsys within a template.

+ are modular units which realize specific functionality to present your content on your website
+ are re-usable
+ are developed as self-contained units within one folder of the repository
+ have no hidden configuration files
+ can contain other components
+ can run anywhere within any CQ system. They can also be limited to run under specific components
+ have a standardized user interface
+ use widgets
+ have an edit behavior that can be configured

###As components are modular, you can develop a new component on your local instance, then deploy this seamlessly to your test, then live environments.

Each CQ component:
+ is a resource type
+ is a collection of scripts that completely realize a specific function
+ can function in "isolation"; this means either within CQ or a portal
