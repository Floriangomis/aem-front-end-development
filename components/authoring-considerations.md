Design for Your Users
=====================

As a AEM developer, who are my users?

Your users are the authors who manage the CMS.

Before designing a component, think about the following

+ If there are too many configurable or authorable fields, can it be simplified?
 
+ If there are 30 or more of this component  on a page, will it exhaust the memory in the authoring environment?
 
+ If so, it should be a candidate for a configurable display wherein the output is driven for from a node.
